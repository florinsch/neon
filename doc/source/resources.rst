Besides the user guide and API, be sure to check out our `Model
Zoo <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/wiki/Model-Zoo>`__ for the
latest state-of-the art models.

We also have other external resources:

- `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lTti-RmeQQ&feature=youtu.be>`__ tutorial from the SD meetup, where we used these `ipython notebooks <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/meetup>`__.
- Our `blog <http://www.nervanasys.com/blog/>`__. In particular:

    - `Deep Reinforcement Learning with neon <http://www.nervanasys.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-with-neon/>`__: Train neural networks to play Atari games
    - `neon with Multi-GPU on Nervana cloud <http://www.nervanasys.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-with-neon/>`__: Train neural nets 7.2x faster with multiple GPUs
    - `neon on Kepler/AWS vs Titan/Nervana Cloud <http://www.nervanasys.com/neon-v1-2-release-kepler-aws-support-are-back-deep-resnets-and-more/>`__: Train neural nets 70x faster on the Nervana cloud vs. AWS
- The `neon users group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/neon-users>`__
- `Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions>`__ competitions using neon:

    - `Whale <https://github.com/anlthms/whale-2015>`__ challenge
    - `BCI <https://www.kaggle.com/anlthms/grasp-and-lift-eeg-detection/convnet-0-89>`__ challenge
- `Demos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXAoLgwZtKciSirfuEWNacPhxCBTiNY2T>`__ of neon capabilities including speech, video and reinforcement learning
- Convert caffe models to neon with `caffe2neon <https://github.com/NervanaSystems/caffe2neon>`__

Deep Learning
-------------

To learn about deep learning in general, we recommend the following
resources:

-  `Hinton Coursera: Neural Networks for Machine
   learning <https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets>`__
-  `Hugo Larochelle's Neural networks
   class <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Xpj9I5qXYEcOhn7TqghAJ6NAPrNmUBH>`__
-  `Karpathy's CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual
   Recognition <http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/>`__
-  `Nando de Freitas' Deep Learning
   Course <https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/>`__

There are also several textbooks:

- `Learning Deep Architectures for AI <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/papers/ftml_book.pdf>`__, by Yoshua Bengio
- `Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview <http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DeepLearning28May2014.pdf>`__ by Jurgen Schmidhuber
