:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

|neo|_ is Nervana_ â€™s Python-based deep learning library. It provides
ease of use while delivering the highest performance.

Features include:

* Support for commonly used models including convnets, RNNs, LSTMs, and
  autoencoders.  You can find many pre-trained implementations of these in our
  `model zoo`_
* Tight integration with our `state-of-the-art`_ GPU kernel library
* 3s/macrobatch (3072 images) on AlexNet on Titan X (Full run on 1 GPU ~ 32 hrs)
* Basic automatic differentiation support
* Framework for visualization
* Swappable hardware backends: write code once and deploy on CPUs, GPUs, or Nervana hardware

New features in this release:

* Faster RCNN model
* Sequence to Sequence container and char_rae recurrent autoencoder model
* Reshape Layer that reshapes the input [#221]
* Pip requirements in requirements.txt updated to latest versions [#289]
* Remove deprecated data loaders and update docs
* Use NEON_DATA_CACHE_DIR envvar as archive dir to store DataLoader ingested data
* Eliminate type conversion for FP16 for CUDA compute capability >= 5.2
* Use GEMV kernels for batch size 1
* Alter delta buffers for nesting of merge-broadcast layers
* Support for ncloud real-time logging
* Add fast_style Makefile target
* Fix Python 3 builds on Ubuntu 16.04
* Run setup.py for sysinstall to generate version.py [#282]
* Fix broken link in mnist docs
* Fix conv/deconv tests for CPU execution and fix i32 data type
* Fix for average pooling with batch size 1
* Change default scale_min to allow random cropping if omitted
* Fix yaml loading
* Fix bug with image resize during injest
* Update references to the ModelZoo and neon examples to their new locations
* See `change log`_.

We use neon internally at Nervana to solve our `customers' problems`_
in many domains. Consider joining us. We are hiring across several
roles. Apply here_!
